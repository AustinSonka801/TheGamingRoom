Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? 
The client is The Gaming Room. They have a game called Draw It or Lost It for Android. The client wanted to improve the software functionality and to expand to other platforms. I tried my best in making this documentation easy to understand and clear.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? 
Deciding what tasks are important and which ones don't need time and focus on. That way i can do the important task first then do the least important ones last.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 
Making the development requirements was a bit diffucult. I would go back to that area and improve on that making it more clear.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
I took what the usefulness of the amusement and made a difference part it up so that there would be less work and time spend growing to other working stages. All whereas still keeping the diversion the same.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? 
I put my center on clear documentation and seperating amusement and diversion needs usefulness to permit less demanding upgrades and maintenence.
